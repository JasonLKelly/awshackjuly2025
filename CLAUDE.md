# Instructions for Claude

## File Review Protocol
Always review the following markdown files before working on any task:
- `overview.md` - Project overview and architecture
- `adsimulator.md` - Ad simulator component details
- `agent-ux.md` - Agent UX component details

These files contain important context about the project structure, components, and implementation details that should inform your work.

## Server Management
Don't start servers. Just tell me to restart or start servers and give me the steps.

## Memorization Protocol
- Always memorize key instructions and project-specific guidelines
- Review and update memories as the project evolves
- Keep memories concise and action-oriented
